                    I believe that programmers should have an approach to programming that does not simply include the technical skills involved in most software engineering work, but an eye for design, art, and a creativity that allows them to push the boundaries of the tools they master. As such, I am not only a computer science major but an Integrated Digital Media minor. Attached is some of the best work I have done in my minor. Some of the projects on openprocessing may need to be run locally.

                                    <h3>Audio Final</h3>
                                </div>                        </a>
                            This is a final project I created in Reaper for my Audio Foundations class. I tried to sync audio with the footage from a famous Looney Toons cartoon "Rabbit Fire". The original scene is pretty funny, but I always wondered how Elmer Fudd understood them, and, assuming that he did, what their interactions would sound like to an outsider. The most important part of this was replacing the dialogue between Bugs and Daffy with recordings of real life bunnies and ducks. Some of the audio used was re-timed and re-pitched to fit a characterâ€™s expression or to sync the noises to its mouth. I also redid the original sound effects, updating them slightly and using sounds that I thought would fit with the cartoonish violence.

                                </div>                        </a>
                            This is an assignment that I worked on for my creative coding class using p5js. I wanted to experiment to see how many different patterns I could create using just one primary shape. I experimented with colors, interactivity and different p5js functions to see what I could come up with, and I found the result very interesting. Some functions seem to have deprecated, so it may be worth attempting to run the project locally.

                                </div>
                        </a>
                            This was my final project submission for my creative coding class. It is a side scrolling Western role playing game. The gameplay mechanics were somewhat hard to figure out in p5js, a library not made for games, but I made do. Collision detection was something I had trouble figuring out with the camera, but I eventually ended up with a pretty good project. All the artwork was drawn by me.

                                </div></a>
                            This is another p5js project that I did. It is a two phase art piece that attempts to evoke feelings of dissociation and anxiety in the viewer. This was my first time experimenting with object oriented programming in p5js, and it was difficult to figure out at first. Sadly I could not get this program running on openprocessing but it should still be viewable if downloaded from Github.
