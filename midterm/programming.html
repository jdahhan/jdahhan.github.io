                            This is my senior capstone project that I am working on with three classmates. We are attempting to create the infrastrucutre for a music based social media app. The <a href = 'https://put-me-on.herokuapp.com/'>backend</a> (<a href = "https://github.com/ecabreja623/PutMeOn">repo</a>) is a Flask API using a noSQL Mongo cloud database. This project is also an opportunity to familiarize myself with various Agile practices like kanban, unit testing, continous integration with Travis and Github Actions and continous deployment with Heroku. The <a href = 'https://putmeon.netlify.app/'></a>frontend</a> (<a href = 'https://github.com/jdahhan/PutMeOn_Frontend'>repo</a>) is currently being built in React and being deployed to Netlify.

                        <p>
                            This is a project that I did with a group called STEM-Away. I was the technical lead for the project, which was to reproduce the research done in the titular <a href = "https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004216">2015 research paper by Percha and Altman.</a> The project involved many machine learning and NLP practices, including supervised and unsupervised biclustering, web scraping, XML parsing, and dependency parsing to cluster drug-gene relationships in over 23 million unorganized medical articles distributed across dozens of gigabytes of XML files. It was a great challenge to help coordinate such a project, especially given the fact that many group members were joining us from abroad and the entire project was done remotely, but I think we did a great job.

                        <p>
                            This was my final assignment submission for my introduction to machine learning class. I employed NLP to classify news articles from a kraggle database of over 45000 articles as fake or real news. The project has a thoroughly written Jupyter notebook as well as documentation to explain the process, but I tried support vector machines, neural networks, and logistic regression to find the best model for this task. The best model achieved a test accuracy greater than 97%.

                            This project was my final submission for my introductory databases course in SQL. A partner and I collaborated to build a sample airline management system. We built the (relatively crude) frontend in HTML and CSS and used Pytorch and MySQL for the backend. The underlying SQL database uses 13 interconnected tables, and the project required 26 HTML pages built from scratch. It also employs data visualization using matplotlib, and is resistant to SQL injection attacks.
