                    Hello! I am Johnlouis Dahhan, an aspiring programmer and senior at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering. As a child we not have the most up to date computing infrastructure. I remember being in kindergarten waiting for my parents to get off the phone so we could use dial-up on our Windows 98 desktop to go on to the PBS Kids website. Luckily through good school programs and caring teachers I have been given many opportunities to use state of the art software and really develop my skills. I hope I can use these skills to give back to the communities that gave me so much, and help expand the ways in which technology can help us live more fulfilling lives.
