        <h1>Response to Baudrillard's the Ecstacy of Communication</h1>
        <p>In Baudrillard's the Ecstacy of Communication, Baudrillard highlights the concept of objects that shape our perspectives more than we shape theirs. This is a concept that has only become more relevant, as I hope to prove in this response.</p>

                    The creation of the smart home is probably one of the more dystopian ways in which objects can shape our lives. Allowing these objects into our homes is not a one way street, they are feedback loops, which collect data and algorithmically guide the user to become its conception of a better homeowner, neighbor and citizen.

                    Smart phones are designed to trigger our dopaminergic responses and build chemical dependencies, but when this becomes an issue worth more to solve than to permit to continue, Apple rolls out the screentime feature, allowing the object which controls our day to day lives to further guide our use of it.

                    Consuming entertainment media is not the passive act it once was. Media has always departed morals and lessons, which shape our tastes and behavior. However, streaming services also help develop our object oriented environments by algorithmically tracking our consumption habits, and tailoring the media we are shown based on the data it collects.
