                This video depicts a scene from the game "Bayonetta", an action game in which the player controls the titular Bayonetta, a witch who kills angels. Despite the player "role playing" as the character, it is impossible to avoid the voyeuristic nature of her depiction. She dances erotically and shows her body for the player. The player is not invited to relate to or act as Bayonetta, they are invited to view her. It depicts a woman who is showing her body with no ostensible audience, indulging herself in her vanity. And yet, the player dictates her every move for their own pleasure. If a player views themselves in Bayonetta, it can only be through their perception of themself as an object of desire, as something to be percieved by others.

                As Berger points out, the proliferation of photography has resulted in our collective inundation by images. What he could not have foreseen was how violently this process would be accelerated by social media. It is not uncommon to see Instagram "stories" in which a friend will post an image of grotesque violence and injustice, sandwiched between selfies and discussions of celebrity gossip. While social media clearly mirrors Berger's idea of a painting collection as a ledger of all the items and associated prestige that one possesses, what seems novel is the incorporation of the moral prestige required in the modern age. We are expected to use the same platform to simultaneously signal our moral outrage and empathy under the guise of spreading awareness, as well as upkeep our personal aesthetic brand. In this ecology, images like this one of Ricky Gervais making a dramatic point about atheism only serve to cheapen the tragedies they invoke.

                The crudest summary of "Ways of Seeing" is that different images are viewed in different ways. This image depicts a seemingly happy man and woman, likely a romantic couple if not friends. However, highlighting the body language using the green lines suddenly changes the context. The emphasis of their posture adds another layer: is she leaning away out of discomfort or disinterest? This edit was done by a Twitter user who is well known for emphasizing body language using these green lines in the service of misogynistic narratives about love and gender. With 2 lines an image can go from a wholesome celebration of love to a dissection of someone's percieved romantic failure.

                This image depicts recruitment material for the white nationalist group Identity Evropa. In Ways Of Seeing, John Berger tries to demystify art as it is consumed. He discusses how the attempts of art historians to contextualize art end up revering it to a religious extent. This poster is an almost absurd extension of this idea. It is one example of many posters which use European statues as a backdrop for vague calls for white identitarianism. In these, the virtue of fighting for an undefined white identity is not argued, nor is the virtue of the statue in frame. The statue is virtuous (and relevant) because it is a product of European culture, which is virtuous because it is capable of producing these statues.

                In Ways of Seeing, John Berger argues that the nude is a way of objectifying women. Through the nude, the naked body stops being a reflection of an inner self, but is posed as something to be consumed and observed. Despite this being widely applicable to depictions of women, it is incredibly exemplified in the form of the frequently male bodybuilder. This image depicts famous actor, former governor, and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger doing an iconic bodybuilder pose. His pose does not betray much about him, he is almost naked and his face is obscured so his expression cannot be observed. This is hardly a candid picture, he is flexing every visible muscle in his body to emphasize his physique, which is so muscular and contorted that it is almost unrecognizable as a human body. This is a body that exists to be consumed, not sexually, as many images of women are made to be consumed, but as a reflection of the possibilities of the human form.
